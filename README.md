# Wave Function Collapse Algorithm Implementation

## Overview

This repository contains an implementation of the Wave Function Collapse (WFC) algorithm using Python and Pygame. The WFC algorithm is a procedural generation technique that can be used to create complex patterns from simple rules, often resembling natural textures or structures.

## Features

- **Wave Function Collapse Algorithm**: Generates a grid based on predefined tile constraints.
- **Pygame Integration**: Visualizes the generated grid in real-time.
- **Retry Logic**: Handles contradictions in the wave function by retrying up to 5 times.

## Requirements

- Python 3.6+
- Pygame
- NumPy

You can install the required packages using pip:
